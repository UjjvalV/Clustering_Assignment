# Clustering (102153029)

In this assignment, I explored various clustering algorithms using different preprocessing techniques and evaluated them based on different metrics. The dataset utilized was the well-known Iris Dataset.

## The clustering techniques employed were:

##### 1- K-Means Clustering (KM)
##### 2- Hierarchical Clustering (HC)
##### 3- Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)
##### 4- Spectral Clustering (SC)
##### 5- Affinity Propagation (AP)
##### 6- Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS)
##### 7- Mean Shift Clustering (MS)


### The evaluation metrics considered were:

Silhouette Score
Calinski-Harabasz Score
Davies-Bouldin Score
For preprocessing, I applied:

### Normalization
PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
Transform
Scale

It's important to note that the absence of a 'scale' column in the DBSCAN results is due to DBSCAN's different approach to similarity metrics, which doesn't heavily rely on scaling as KMeans or hierarchical clustering algorithms do.

## 1- Kmeans
